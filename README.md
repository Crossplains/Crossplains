- 👋 Howdy, I’m @Crossplains
- 👀 I have a great variety of interest but here I am interested in becoming a well rounded and capable programer. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python. I started out long ago with HTML (2000) and more recently tried my hand at Java. I have found the most growth and success in Python so that is where I'm focusing my efforts.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a variety of projects. I have a special interest in data analysis, nonprofits and educational organizations. I am currently a teacher and I'm looking to expand my programming skills while building a portfolio that will allow me to change careers in the next few years.
- 📫 feel free to reach out to me via email jaredplamb@yahoo.com or you can find me on Facebook though admittedly I use the platform very little anymore.
